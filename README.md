# SmartDelivery
Intelligent Delivery Route Optimizer

### High-Level Design Overview of SmartDelivery
Core Architecture
The SmartDelivery project will be built on Ruby on Rails with a modular design pattern. It will utilize a service-oriented architecture to separate business logic (like route optimization and driver assignment) from the main application logic, making it more maintainable and testable.

Core Components

1. Models (Database Layer)
Represent real-world entities: Order, Driver, Route, DeliveryBatch.
Focus on relationships, validations, and simple data-related methods.

2. Controllers (Application Layer)
Handle HTTP requests, route them to appropriate services, and respond with data or views.
Only coordinate work, keeping them "thin" and delegating heavy lifting to services.

3. Services (Business Logic Layer)
Contain reusable, testable business logic like graph algorithms for routing, driver assignments, and scheduling.
Examples:
RouteOptimizer for graph traversal.
DriverAssigner for assigning drivers based on capacity and location.

4. Jobs (Asynchronous Processing)
Use ActiveJob with Sidekiq to offload heavy computations like route optimization or batch processing to background workers.

### Database Design (ERD)
Entities:

Order
id, pickup_location, dropoff_location, weight, priority, status
Associations: belongs_to :driver, has_many :routes.

Driver
id, name, vehicle_capacity, current_location, available
Associations: has_many :orders.

Route
id, start_location, end_location, distance
Associations: belongs_to :order.

DeliveryBatch
id, batch_name, total_weight
Associations: has_many :orders.

### Design Patterns

Service Object Pattern
Business logic encapsulated in classes, such as:
RouteOptimizer: Handles graph-based routing.
DriverAssigner: Handles driver allocation.

Observer Pattern
Use Rails' ActiveRecord::Callbacks to trigger events when certain actions happen (e.g., automatically assign a driver when an order is created).

Decorator Pattern
Use Rails decorators (via ActiveSupport::Concern or gems like draper) to format data for the view layer (e.g., presenting routes in a readable format).

Factory Method Pattern
Generate dummy data or test objects during testing.

### Flow Diagram
Workflow

User creates orders.
System calculates optimal route using RouteOptimizer.
Driver is assigned using DriverAssigner.
Orders are grouped into batches using KnapsackSolver.
Routes and updates are tracked and displayed in real-time.

Request-Response Cycle
HTTP Request → Controller → Service Object (e.g., RouteOptimizer) → Model → Response.
Background Job → Queue → Service → Model Update → Notify via ActionCable.
